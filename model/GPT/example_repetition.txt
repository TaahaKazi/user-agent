If you think the conversation is complete or being repetitive, please type ' <COMPLETE_CONVERSATION>' in the chat.
And if the System: and User: are stuck in a repetitive conversation type ' <REPETITION>' in the chat.
Also, the TOD system is stupid, so ask all questions like you  are talking to a five-year-old, i.e. break down your requests
into simpler statements.
Make user statements simple and clear. Ask things one by one.
