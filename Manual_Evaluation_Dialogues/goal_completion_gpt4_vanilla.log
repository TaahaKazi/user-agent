###Feedback: 
The system did not complete all the tasks given to it. The user-agent asked for a local place to dine that serves Spanish food, which the system provided. The user-agent also asked for a cheap price range, which the system acknowledged. The system also provided the location information as requested by the user-agent. However, when the user-agent asked for a place to go in town, specifically a college in the same area as the restaurant, the system failed to provide a specific recommendation. The system also failed to confirm the booking for 3 people at 14:30 on Friday, instead repeating the restaurant information. Lastly, the user-agent asked to book a taxi to commute between the two places, but the system did not confirm the booking, instead repeating the restaurant and attraction information.

###Feedback: 
The system was asked to book a taxi for the user-agent. It asked for the type of car and the phone number for the taxi company. However, the user-agent did not provide this information. Instead, the user-agent provided the departure and arrival locations. The system then confirmed that it had booked a taxi, specifying the car type and providing a contact number, neither of which were provided by the user-agent. Therefore, it is unclear how the system obtained this information. Furthermore, the system did not confirm the departure and arrival locations with the user-agent. As such, it cannot be confirmed that the system completed all the tasks given to it.
