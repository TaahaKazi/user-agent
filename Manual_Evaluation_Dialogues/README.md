The 3 files (thought_50.txt, vanilla_50.txt, verbose_50_.txt) contain 50 dialogues each based on the same 50 initial user goals

NOTE: The task completion evaluation (GSR metric) is based solely on the dialogue and ignores the initial user goal.
This is because the user-simulator may sometimes misinterpret or miss user goals from the initial instruction. 
Therefore, the TOD model should be evaluated solely based on the dialogues.

Also, I have added the results from the auto evaluation scripts.
